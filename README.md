### Description:
Aamir Khan is once of the most influential Bollywood actors of his time with a career in Indian cinema spanning over thirty years. While his films have always enjoyed domestic success, Khan also rose to international fame as well. Most noticeably, he's gained stardom in China where he's referred to as "Uncle Aamir" (South China Morning Post). Our goal for this project was to visualize Khan's success in domestic, Chinese, and International markets over time. We did so by collecting the box office records for films starring Aamir Khan in non-cameo roles from years 2000 to 2018.
